README for smail
================

SMail is a very lightweight email library, based on Perl's Email::Simple.

It implements the minimal functions to enable the easy creation or parsing of an
email message that conforms to RFC 2822.

It is intended to be the first of a family of SMail::* modules that will deal with
many common email standards.

It is still a work in progress and the interface may change.

Download & Install
==================

    sudo gem install mwalker-smail--source http://gems.github.com

    email = SMail.new(text)

    old_body = email.body
    email.body = "Hello World!\nMatthew"
